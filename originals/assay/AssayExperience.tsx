/**
 * ABYSS LINE — Sunken Treasure. Top-level experience (2026-07-06 re-skin from
 * the prior dark-stone Aztec register). The wreck of the "Golden Sledge",
 * 3,800m deep: a fixed underwater scene (the supplied `abyss-background.svg` —
 * water gradient, godrays, trench walls, kelp, seafloor, wreck treasure, a naval
 * mine, and the SUB with its cyan porthole + amber lamp + light cone on the
 * board) frames a board of gold DUCATS. The diver traces a claim line of ducats,
 * then RUNS THE LINE (commit once) to run it ducat-to-ducat; one cracked ducat
 * (a naval mine) busts the dive. The board is the centerpiece; the control
 * column carries DIVE DEPTH, CLAIM LINE, the brass HAUL gauge, YOUR BET and the
 * single cyan CTA. Settlement is the Glass Box receipt (house-wide concept, kept).
 *
 * PALETTE / RULE OF THREE (strict): gold (`GOLD`/`GOLD_LIGHT`/`GOLD_DARK`) = value
 * (balance, multipliers, haul, chips, ducat body, needle); player cyan
 * (`PLAYER`/`PLAYER_DEEP`/`PLAYER_TEXT`) = the player (route seal + number +
 * connector, toggles, primary CTA, sub-light); red (`BLOOD`) = danger (mine,
 * cracked, bust). Panels/text use the Abyss water tokens (`STONE_*`/`INK`/`BONE`/
 * `SAND`, `BRASS_*` = the steel-panel family). Cyan + gold return together but
 * stay spatially separated (never on the same element).
 *
 * BACKGROUND. The supplied `abyss-background.svg` is drawn as a full-cover page
 * background: "the background never moves, only board contents + panel states
 * change." A per-depth `DepthTint` overlay recolors the SAME scene per DIVE DEPTH
 * (reef lighter / midnight default / hadal darker + red lamp dots).
 *
 * JUICE (RG-C5: all celebration timings/amplitudes are module consts, identical
 * regardless of streak, session balance, or payout). Every claimed ducat flies a
 * gold coin from the board to the HAUL gauge (symbol→meter, exact per-ducat delta
 * via `coinDeltaBps`); the gauge needle swings + overshoots to the running total;
 * a fixed "SECURED THE HAUL" hero-pop fires once on any fully-claimed line; a
 * bust fires the red shockwave. The board canvas owns the ducat reveal/mine
 * satisfaction — see `AssayGridCanvas.tsx`'s own header docblock.
 *
 * NAME "ABYSS LINE" (display + wordmark). Folder slug stays `assay`; internal ids
 * (`TierId`, `phase.kind`, engine/component names) and ALL math are untouched —
 * this is a skin/color/vocabulary/backdrop/asset pass only.
 *
 * Engine/UI boundary: this file reads engine values and renders; all math lives
 * in `assayMath.ts` / `assayProvider.ts`. No payout arithmetic here.

// makes each tile bigger at that SAME board size (guard: this pass must not
// silently fold new chrome into `CHROME_RESERVE_PX` in a way that shrinks
// the board — verified live via the render pass, not just by inspection).
//
// CTA-BELOW-FOLD FIX (visual-regression 2026-07-03, holdgate): the original
// CHROME_RESERVE_PX=300 was budgeted against the PLANNING-phase chrome only
// (~294px measured). The SETTLED phase is TALLER — it adds the Glass Box
// certificate block + the DIVE AGAIN →/CLOSE row on top of the same header —
// and that taller assembly was never re-budgeted, so at 1440×900 the old
// MIN_BOARD_PX=660 floor forced a board bigger than the settled state's real
// height budget, pushing "DIVE AGAIN →" 59-102px below the fold (worse at
// 1920×1080 too, 0-42px). `desktopBoardPx` is a SINGLE value shared by every
// phase (the board can't resize mid-round), so it must be budgeted against
// the TALLEST phase (settled), not the shortest (planning).
// Fix = two parts:
//  1. Re-measured CHROME_RESERVE_PX against the SETTLED assembly (the real
//     worst case), after also compacting that assembly's own padding/
//     line-height/margins (settled block, Glass Box certificate strip, page
//     padding, board-wrapper padding — see those call sites) so the board
//     doesn't have to shrink more than necessary to buy back the fit.
//     Live-measured non-board settled overhead (header + wordmark + page
//     padding + board-wrapper padding + settled block, everything except the
//     canvas itself) is a TRUE CONSTANT across viewport heights — 348px at
//     both 1440×900 and 1920×1080 (`scrollHeight - boardRect.height`,
//     `assay-run/holdgate-settled-cta-0703.mjs`) — plus a ~20px safety
//     margin for cross-browser font-metric variance = 368, rounded to 370.
//  2. MIN_BOARD_PX lowered from 660 to a pure SAFETY floor (480) rather than
//     a target size, so it only binds on genuinely tiny windows
//     (<480+370=850px tall) instead of overriding the height-driven formula
//     at ordinary short-desktop heights like 900 and forcing an overflow —
//     this IS the "lower the board floor on short viewports" fix: at
//     1440×900 the formula alone now yields 900-370=530 (floor never binds),
//     at 1920×1080 it yields 710, and the 2560×1440 cap (960) is untouched —

          below the fold on Pixel 7 / iPhone 14 Pro. `isWide` branches to a
          single-row, 3-up `TierChip` segmented control instead (one ~52px
          row) — same contract (`active`/`disabled`/`onClick`), same real
          per-tier math, far less height. Desktop keeps the richer `TierRow`
          stack — it isn't fold-constrained the same way. `railRows` is still
          ONE shared JSX tree (composition-designer's original discipline);
          only this one section branches internally on viewport, so the wide
          rail and the narrow bottom-dock still can never drift apart on
          everything else. */}

 *  itself while a tally is live (the same "real instrument reading a live
 *  current" discipline as the board's own bead pulse). Purely a display
 *  scale against the real max ladder value — never affects payout math.
 *  `size` scales the whole SVG (same viewBox, just a bigger/smaller render

 *  (e.g. only the revealed count changed) still reads the WHOLE sentence,
 *  not just the changed substring, which would be incomprehensible out of
 *  context. Visually hidden via the standard clip-rect technique (not
 *  `display:none`, which would remove it from the accessibility tree

        // lives far below at y≈781, so no CTA overlap either.
